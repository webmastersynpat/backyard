<div>Hello Matthew, I understand that patent/licenses acquisitions and sales are within the scope of your responsibility at Broadcom.&nbsp;</div><div>We recently launched our patent license store and I'd like to personally introduce it to you. &nbsp;One of our first portfolios relates to LTE, and presumably is essential to Release 11 of the standard, which Broadcom might be interested in reviewing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We sell patent licenses like commodity – at our online store. The licenses are offered on a patent portfolio basis and each portfolio has its own price tag that is the same for all our customers. &nbsp;Our customers – operating companies only – browse the catalog and comfortably and safely buy licenses to patent portfolios they want.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="http://images16.fotki.com/v301/photos/3/341861/3483095/dggggg-vi.jpg"><br></div><div><br></div><div>Our acquisition of each patent portfolio is crowdfunded by our customers: the seller's asking price is equally divided among the participating customers. &nbsp;In exchange, each funding customer receives a non-exclusive license under the acquired patent portfolio as well as a share in the future sales of licenses under that portfolio. &nbsp;This ensures that only patents desired by our customers enter the store, and that our licenses are offered at the most affordable prices.</div><div><br></div><div>I would like to send Broadcom an invitation to participate in funding the acquisition of this LTE portfolio. Could you please let me know who in Broadcom is the best address?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Regards, &nbsp;</div><div>Uzi</div>
